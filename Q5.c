/* 5. (a) char ****k;
 Ans . i) k is a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a char.

The declaration char ****k; defines k as a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a char. Each * represents a level of indirection. So, k has four levels of indirection, which means it is a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a char.

    int **m=&p;
    **m=6;
